# About SCRUB

SCRUB is a survey to provide behavioural insights for policy and messaging. SCRUB measures behaviours (e.g., staying home) and drivers to understand “who needs to do what differently”. We are using cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling to track behaviour and its drivers over time.

Our vision for this project is an international and continuously-updated dataset that can provide local insights to help government and public health officials make better decisions to fight against the novel coronavirus. 

So far we have about 120 international collaborators, and are supporting country teams in setting up local versions of SCRUB.
