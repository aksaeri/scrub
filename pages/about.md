# About SCRUB

The Survey of COVID-19 Responses to Understand Behaviour (SCRUB) project aims to provide current and future policy makers with actionable insights into public attitudes and behaviours relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Building on the COSMO project, a WHO/Europe initiative - we are running a "living survey" -- with both repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling -- running throughout the pandemic. In this survey we track relevant protective behaviours, (e.g., handwashing and social distancing) their variations by demographic and location, and their determinants. We also test interventions.

After each wave of data collection, we generate and disseminate an updated report. 

We have about 120 international collaborators, and are supporting country teams in setting up local versions of SCRUB. More than 4000 people across 40 countries have participated in SCRUB.

## Who is the team? 

**READI** is a group of volunteers who conduct research and provide evidence-informed, rigorous and implementable recommendations for practitioners working in Effective Altruism cause areas. Michael Noetel, Alexander Saeri and Peter Slattery are academic researchers who met at EAGx Sydney in 2017 and founded READI in 2019. Together with Emily Grundy, they initiated the SCRUB project and support its international work. Find out more at [https://www.readiresearch.org](https://www.readiresearch.org)

**BehaviourWorks Australia** brings leading behaviour change researchers from Monash University together with practitioners in government and industry to explore and understand the human side of everyday problems and identify who needs to do what differently. As a multidisciplinary research enterprise within the Monash Sustainable Development Institute, BWA endeavours to support efforts to address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals by conducting research and providing knowledge on how behavioural science can be used to tackle SDG-related problems.
