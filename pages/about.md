# About SCRUB

The Survey of COVID-19 Responses to Understand Behaviour (SCRUB) project aims to provide current and future policy makers with actionable insights into public attitudes and behaviours relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Building on the COSMO project, a WHO/Europe initiative - we are running a "living survey" -- with both repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling -- running throughout the pandemic. In this survey we track relevant protective behaviours, (e.g., handwashing and social distancing) their variations by demographic and location, and their determinants. We also test interventions.

After each wave of data collection, we generate and disseminate an updated report. 

We have about 120 international collaborators, and are supporting country teams in setting up local versions of SCRUB. More than 4000 people across 40 countries have participated in SCRUB.
