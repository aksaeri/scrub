# Behavioural Insights

## Australians' responses to COVID-19, March 2020

Managing the impact of COVID-19 requires widespread adoption of public health behaviours such as physical distancing and effective handwashing. In this report, we describe key protective behaviours and their drivers in a sample of 1246 Australians collected 27 March – 5 April 2020. Use of this evidence to inform policy response and messaging will improve Australians’ health.

### Recommendations for Australian policy actors

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Target young people with specific interventions to encourage keeping distance in public and effective handwashing. Further diagnosis of this sub-group may be required</li>
<li>Enable and support home delivery for regular shopping needs, as they are an important barrier to practicing physical distancing and staying at home.</li>
<li>Provide support for parents with children to increase their likelihood of staying at home</li>
<li>Encourage new habits to replace touching face with unwashed hands</li>
<li>Persuasive messaging must emphasise that many COVID-19 cases are occuring in the 50-69 age bracket; respondents in the 50-59 and 60-69 age group underestimated their relative likelihood of being infected with COVID-19, compared to the current case count from NNDSS</li>
</ol>

### Behavioural adherence

The Australian Government Department of Health recommends five key behaviours to stop the spread of COVID-19. The majority of Australians are doing these behaviours. Men are less likely to perform protective behaviours than females. Older adults (50+) were also more likely to practice protective behaviours such as handwashing and social distancing in the last 7 days, than those below 50. However, older adults are also less likely to avoid touching their faces.

### Behavioural diagnosis

The practical COM-B model can help identify why people engage in behaviours of which they are **Aware**. **Capability** involves the skills and knowledge to do the behaviour. **Opportunity** includes access to resources and a social or physical environment that enables the behaviour. **Motivation** includes emotion, goals and beliefs about consequences of the behaviour. **Motivation and capability were the most influential drivers** for each of the five key behaviours, but all four drivers uniquely and significantly predicted key behaviours.

**The contextualised drivers differ across key behaviours**. Staying at home is influenced by availability of mental stimulation and social interaction at home, a person’s ability to work from home, and meeting their food and supply needs. In contrast, touching one’s face is most influenced by habits and reminders. We tested five different persuasive messaging strategies (e.g., social norm, authoritative source, see p.6 for list) on respondents’ commitment (“pledge”) to perform the five key behaviours over the next month. Each strategy was more effective than no persuasive message, but effectiveness did not differ between strategies.

| Behaviour | Motivation | Capability | Opportunity | Awareness |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| **All protective behaviour** | (+) Everyone else doing it, (+) save lives | (+) Clear and precise instructions | (+) Being able to stay at home | (-) conflicting scientific and political advice |
| **Cover mouth when cough / sneeze** | (+) Prior habits | (+) Prior habits | (+) Seeing others do it | (-) less coverage, too many precautions mentioned |
| **Keep distance in public** | (+) Employer advice | (-) prior habit, can’t stay at home for some reason, Shopping, other people’s behaviour | (-) Seeing others not do it | (-) distance keeps changing, being at home with people | 
| **Wash hands for 20s with soap** | (+) Prior habits, (-) Lack of habit, dry hands, being at home |  (+) Clear and precise instructions, (-) prior habits, dry eyes, itches | (-) Lack of hand sanitizer | (-) Not clear prior habits are bad |
| **Stay at home** | (-) Boredom | (+) Open areas to walk, parents home to support | (+) Encouragement from others, support from work | (-) disconnected from information sources | 
| **NOT touch face with unwashed hands** | (-) Prior habits | (+) Encouragement from others | (-) Not in some lists/emphasised |
