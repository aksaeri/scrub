# Resources for open and reproducible science

Many of the tools, code, data, and process we have used in this project will be made available in the spirit of [open and reproducible science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021).

If you would like to access any of the below, please [email us](peter.slattery@monash.edu). We intend to make these materials directly available through the Open Science Framework.

* Deidentified data from SCRUB
* RMarkdown code used to generate SCRUB reports and dashboards
* SCRUB survey file (Word, Qualtrics, Google Docs, REDCap)
* SCRUB data dictionary
