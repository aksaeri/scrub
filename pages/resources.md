# Resources for open and reproducible science

Many of the tools, code, data, and process we have used in this project will be made available in the spirit of [open and reproducible science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021).

Visit our [Open Science Framework project](https://osf.io/u5x3r/) to access the survey materials, data dictionary, de-identified open science data, and analysis code.

The [SCRUB international research protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4i5pClbl-YKSLXZhW4x2RkxAEzGRvrhkgPe8Q_rVP0/edit#) is available through Google Docs.
