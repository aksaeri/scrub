# Survey of COVID-19 Responses to Understand Behaviour (SCRUB)

The SCRUB project aims to provide current and future policy makers with actionable insights into public attitudes and behaviours relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Building on the COSMO project, a WHO/Europe initiative - we are running a “living survey” -- with both repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling --  throughout the pandemic. In this survey we track relevant protective behaviours (e.g., handwashing and social distancing) their variations by demographic and location, and their determinants. We also test interventions.

After each wave of data collection, we generate and disseminate an updated report to relevant policy actors. 

More than 10,000 surveys in more than 40 countries have already been completed.

The SCRUB project is led by [READI](https://www.readiresearch.org/) in partnership with [BehaviourWorks Australia](https://behaviourworksaustralia.org), Monash Sustainable Development Institute, Monash University and Australian Catholic University; and a group of more than 100 international researchers.
